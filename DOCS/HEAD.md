## About us

BioSoc Society hopes to empower all community members to be makers and creators rather than passive recipients. 
Everyone is encouraged to contribute, no matter what skill level.
We support over a dozen applications in the synthetic biology community and many on Github.
Contributions require testing, bug reports, user documentation, and code examples.
